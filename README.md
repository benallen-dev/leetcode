# Leetcode

Some folks grind leetcode because they think that's how you get a job in software engineering.

I'm just doing these for fun and practice.

PS: After doing a couple I notice two things:

1. Leetcode doesn't feel like day-to-day software development
2. I am not as good at leetcode as I thought I would be
3. Still kinda fun though
